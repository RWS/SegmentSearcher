# SegmentSearcher (Plugin for SDL Trados Studio)
SegmentSearcher is a Trados Studio plug-in that enables you to search through the documents opened in the Studio editor and list the matched segments in a nicely formatted html table. Once installed, restart SDL Trados Studio and go to the Editor view. In the 'View' tab of the ribbon, there will now be a SegmentSearcher button.

The released version of the plugin can be downloaded from the [plugin page](https://appstore.sdl.com/language/app/segmentsearcher/411/) on SDL AppStore.
